## Users

![users](images/users.png "Users table")

The Users table shows the users that belong to your organization.

For each user you can view basic information such as username, first & last name, role, and group. The __Installation Step__ column shows which part of the installation process has been completed by the user. The __Installation Step__ indicator allows you to track user progress and decide if the user needs further assistance.

The __User Table__ is also used to manage and change user accounts.

## Create User

To create a user

1. At the top right hand corner of the main panel, click __Add User__.
2. From the popup window, enter the user’s information into the displayed fields.
3. Select the role and group that you want the user to be assigned.
4. Click __Create User__ for the changes to take effect.

>**Caution**: Assigning the __Admin__ role to a user will allow them to login and change settings in the Access Control panel. Additionally, any manual user additions or deletions could cause inconsistencies if your organization has an LDAP service running.

### Share User Credentials

Share a user’s credentials by clicking the __share__ icon under user’s username.

![share](images/share-user.png "Share user icon") - ![share](images/share-user-2.png "Share modal")

For more info refer to [Share account credentials in the Applications](../applications/cfg.md#share_account_credentials) section.

### Handle User Access Requests

A user might not have the permissions to access certain URLs or Elements that are blocked by the group they belong to. Refer to [Set Privileged URLs & View/Remove Blocked Elements](../applications/cfg.md#set_privileged_urls). However, they can request access to some restricted elements through the browser extension.

These requests can be displayed by clicking __info__ under the user’s username. From the popup window that comes up, you can review the request and inform the user if his access was granted or rejected.

![access req](images/access-req.png "User access requests")

>**Important**: If you decide to grant access for an element (or URL) to a user, you have to do this manually by adding the user to a group that already has access to the specific element. For example, user A belongs to group G that restricts access to an element E. User A requests access to E. Organization admin can either create a new group that allows access to this element (See Create Organization Group for more info) or add user A to a group H that already have access to element E.

### Edit User

If you wish to edit a user’s data click the button under __Actions__ column. Form this page, you can edit a user’s personal information, assign him a new role and/or add him in a new group. Remember to click __Update user__ for changes to take effect.

Copy a user by clicking on the   button under __Actions__ column.

### Delete User

If you wish to delete a user click the  button under __Actions__ column. This action will perform a soft delete, which means that the user can be retrieved if needed in the future.

![soft delete](images/soft-del.png "Soft deleted user")

In case you want to delete a user permanently, click the __Hard delete__ button after soft delete has been performed. You may also recover the user.

![hard delete](images/hard-del.png "Recover or hard delete a user")

>**Important**: You have to be careful before deleting a user. There might be inconsistencies if an LDAP service is running.

### Provision to Accounts

If you wish to grant access for a user to one or more applications or servers, click on the __provision to accounts__ icon.

![provision](images/prov-to-accts-1.png "Provision to accounts icon") - ![provision](images/prov-to-accts.png "Provision to accounts modal")

This feature will allow users to login to either the selected applications by using newly generated credentials, or the selected servers by choosing one of the existing accounts.

#### Grant User Access to Servers

In the displayed popup window, click __Servers__ radio button and then choose the server you would like to give access to. Then choose one or more accounts that will be given to the user in order to be able to login to the selected server.
<!--

![TODO](images/prov-acct-apps.png "Provision to accounts - Applications") 

The request will be handled by Onion ID Admins and your user will then have access to the selected apps. -->

## Send Initial Registration Code Reminder

It is quite common for users to forget their Initial Registration code. You can send them a reminder email with their code by clicking __Remind Rec Code__ under the __Actions__ column.

### Re-invite User

If you wish to resend the registration email to the user once again, click __Re-Invite__ under the __Actions__ column.

### Delete All LDAP Users

Requirements: You must have imported users from LDAP to perform this action. See in __Import Users from LDAP__ for more info.

If you wish to delete every user that has been previously imported from LDAP, click the __Delete All LDAP Users__ button. We strongly advise you to use this option only when it’s really necessary and in cases of a faulty or mistaken LDAP import.
