# Syncing with Okta

To sync Okta applications with the Thycotic Access Controller:

1. Click __Okta__. 
1. Insert the Okta provided __API key__ and respective __subdomain URL__.

>**Note**: Synchronizing Okta apps with the Thycotic Access Controller allows the latter to apply Blocked Elements and Privileged URLs on those apps. Authentication to those apps will still be done through Okta and not through the Thycotic Access Controller.
